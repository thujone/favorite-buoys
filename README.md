Favorite Buoys is a demo using ReactJS, Google Maps, Gulp, Webpack, ES6, and Babel.

The app loads in buoy data from the National Data Buoy Center. It allows users to view all buoys within a 300-mile radius
of Boston and choose favorite buoys that they can view on a Google Map. The faved buoys are stored via cookies.

The app is not responsive and is optimized for viewports of 1100px width or greater. It has only been checked on Chrome;
there may be layout or javascript issues on other browsers.

Unfortunately, the RSS feed does not support cross-origin requests, and so a Chrome add-on is required to make the app
work. I realize this isn't a good solution, but I don't think the cross-origin problem was meant to be a part of the challenge,
so the add-on seems like an OK workaround.
